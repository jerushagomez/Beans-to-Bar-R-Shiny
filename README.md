# Beans to Bar [RShiny]


## Introduction
This was a group project with six members: Ms.Ayesha Shariff, Ms.Christine, Ms.Gayatri Krishna, Mr.Hitesh S, Mr.Suraj Yadav and myself. The project was executed in RShiny in order to develop an interactive dashboard. 

Chocolates are one of the common cravings among people. Usually distributed during birthdays, it is a feast to the eyes, mouth and the soul. According to the History Channel, the world’s first chocolate bar dates all the way back to 1847. It was created by Joseph Fry with the help of his son, and they made it with cocoa butter, cocoa powder, and sugar. Chocolates have been around for quite a while now. Since humans have this incessant need to invent and innovate, we now have countless number of varieties of chocolates. Chocolates have over six hundred flavour compounds, which is three times the number of flavour compounds in red wine. We get chocolates mostly in two forms – solid and liquid. Furthermore, we have different kinds of chocolates. Broadly, they are categorized into white, milk and dark chocolates.

## Problem Statement 

To understand the different ratings of chocolates, the various factors and the various ways in which these factors affect the chocolate ratings.


## About the Data

## Libraries Used

1. Leaflet
2. leaflet.extras
3. ggplot2
4. plotly
5. shiny
6. shinydashboard
7. DT
8. dplyr
9. shinythemes

## Work Flow
- We have used R shiny to develop a dashboard to explain our findings and insights.
- The HOME tab introduces the topic. It help you gain some insights on the various factors affecting chocolates. 
- The FACT tab gives us a rough idea about the dataset. We have created few info boxes for the same. A bar chart is also plotted that shows the most reviewed ingredient. We have also created a bar plot to depict which is the top 5 ingredients used. The total number of ingredients that we have are 21 combinations.
- The MAP tab shows location Distribution Across Countries and also Average Rating of Bean Origin. 
- The fourth tab is PLOTS. Various plots like Pie chart, Bar plots, Line chart are plotted.


## Result
Through the graphs seen in the dashboard, we can see: 
- Top contributor(country) of chocolate
- Most occurring rating
- The year with the best reviews
- Most reviewed ingredient
- Percentage of Cocoa that is used by most companies
